# Code Refactor Starter Code

Introduction

This code refactored for Challenge 1 includes the CSS and HTML files with corrected and cleaned up code. The website titled Hotriseon includes three sections: Search Engine Optimization, Online Reputation Management and Social Media Marketing. Each section, linked in the header, provides a description of the reader regarding the specific topic. In the sidebar, the topics of: Lead Generation, Brand Awareness and Cost Management are highlighted for the readers in a brief format. The code follows accessibility standards as the header is continuously available on the entire website.

Usage 

Using this website, readers are able to access the sections: Search Engine Optimization, Online Reputation Management and Social Media Marketing by clicking the link in the header. This function will take the readers to the asked location on the website. For example: if a reader clicks the link for Social Media Marketing the website will scroll to the third section located along the right side and centered. This section will highlight the marketing strategies using social media outlets.
